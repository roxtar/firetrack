FireTrack: Firefox extension to track time spent on websites

Madhuri, I AM DISAPPOINT. 
Please stop snooping around and get back to your work.

FireTrack is an extension which tracks time spent on different
websites. 

DESIGN GOALS

- Let the user easily find out her time spent on each website. 

- She shouldn't need to sign up on any other site to access this
  data.

- The addon should be light and fast.

- The addon should work with all major versions of Firefox.

- The data should be exportable (JSON, XML?)

- The data should be importable (for future versions, or maybe to sync
  across browsers)

- Data should be query-able ideally from within the addon or after
  exporting.

- It should be platform independent (Duh!)

- It should (eventually) also work on mobile.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

- Every user has multiple timers. Each domain has one timer associated
  with it. 

- Data is stored locally. Yes. It is by design. I am not a fan of
  repeatedly signing in to websites to access my own data.

- The time spent on each domain is logged whenever the browser is
  running, but only stored per day. 

- The time spent is calculated as:
  
  if(!user_idle()) {
	current_tab_domain = get_current_domain();
	time_spent[current_tab_domain]++;
  }

- There needs to be a disable button.

- The user should be provided with the following charts:
  1. Website percentage (pie chart) -- Top 5 websites which were used.
  2. Hourly activity (bar graph) per website.
  3. Hourly acitivty per hour per website (multi-colored bar graph)

- Data should be available as a browseable website.

- Custom queries. Expose the table/data to the user and let her
  specify the query.

- The Addon will not record statistics when in private-browsing mode.

- Addon should be thread safe.
